/**
 * Provides a managed message channel that can be used to
 * control {@link CamelContext}s. Once activated, the control channel's
 * behavior can be controlled by adding routing instructions via the
 * {@code load} method. Managed {@link CamelContext}s (i.e. those stored
 * as components in the host {@link CamelContext}'s {@link Registry}) can
 * be configured via the {@link ControlChannel#configure} methods.
 * <p>
 * This component is <b>not thread safe</b>. Specifically, there is no
 * guarantee that calls to {@link ControlChannel#activate()} and/or
 * {@link ControlChannel#destroy()} will not stomp on each other,
 * nor are additional control channel and/or managed context route configuration
 * updates synchronized. This component should therefore be considered
 * to be <b>thread-hostile</b> and explicit synchronization used if/when required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An unconfigured channel will do exactly nothing for you. You need to load
 * some configuration for the channel itself first of all, and this is normally
 * done using {@link ControlChannelBootstrapper#bootstrap(ControlChannel)}, so you
 * can look there for further details. 
 * <p>
 * Once configured, the channel remains idle until {@link ControlChannel#activate()} is
 * called. {@link ControlChannel#activate()} returns control to the calling thread
 * once the channel is running.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are several options for stopping the channel. The
 * {@link ControlChannel#destroy()} method abruptly terminates all running services,
 * effectively killing the channel. A more graceful mechanism for shutting down involves
 * waiting for a message to signal that a client has requested shutdown. The default bootstrap
 * scripts create a channel for exactly this purpose, using the uri defined by the
 * {@code axiom.channels.shutdown.uri} system property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A client instructs the channel to shutdown by sending an exchange
 * to the endpoint for this uri, with a header named “signal” set to the value “shutdown.” A
 * consuming thread can then poll for this signal.
 * To simplify this process and do this without having to explicitly use the <i>Camel</i> APIs,
 * the {@link ControlChannel#waitShutdown} method provides this polling facility (with a variation
 * that times out without further action). Before the {@link ControlChannel#waitShutdown} method
 * returns, {@link ControlChannel#destroy()} will be called, effectively terminating the channel.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To explicitly send the 'shutdown' signal yourself, call the {@link ControlChannel#sendShutdownSignal()}
 * method, and to optionally combine this with the {@link ControlChannel#waitShutdown} call, the
 * {@link ControlChannel#sendShutdownSignalAndWait} method can be used. 
 * </p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *
 *      CamelContext camelContext;
 *      RouteLoader  routeLoader;
 *
 *      public static void main(String... argv) {
 *          ControlChannel channel = new ControlChannel(camelContext);
 *          channel.load(routeLoader);
 *          channel.activate();
 *
 *          // to wait for a 'shutdown' signal
 *          channel.waitShutdown(long timeout = 10000);
 *
 *          // alternatively, you can send 'shutdown' yourself
 *          channel.sendShutdownSignal();
 *
 *          // optionally you can combine shutting down and waiting
 *          channel.sendShutdownSignalAndWait(); //optional timeout as before
 * 
 *          // to stop all services
 *          channel.destroy();
 *      }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
