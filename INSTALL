These instructions assume that you have downloaded a binary distribution from
sourceforge.net (or built one yourself using the maven build). 

Standard Installation:

After deflating the distribution archive, you should run the 'install.sh' script
(residing in the top level of the archive), optionally passing the Installation-Target
and Axiom-Home directories as the first and second arguments.
