Introduction
-------------

Axiom (working title) is a framework for testing integration scenarios and
validating expectations about routing/rules and business logic executed in 
a variety of systems integration landscapes.

The projects aims are:

 - Make testing integration scenarios simple(r)
   - Simple to understand
   - Simple to configure, deploy and run axiom itself
   - Simple to hook up to your existing infrastructure
 - Facilitate instrumenting/debugging complex integration architectures (simply)
 - Provide a set of (simple) mechanisms for verifying rules/constraints 
 - Provide immediate feedback in useful formats (surefire reports, rss feeds, email, etc) 

Axiom is distributed under a BSD-style license (please see the LICENSE document for details).

Overview
---------

Axiom is a java application with embedded jruby. It uses the apache camel 
routing/mediation engine to interact with your integration stack (messaging
systems, web servers, service brokers, ESBs, etc). Camel not only integrates 
well with a variety of different transports/protocols, it also provides a rich
routing DSL (in java, scala or spring-xml dialects) which makes for simple configuration.

The camel libraries also provide a lot of the Enterprise Integration Patterns 
as components of the framework, making it simpler and easier to reason about your 
design using well trodden techniques.

Status
-------

Axiom-core is in the Alpha/Prototyping stage but is under active development. We hope
to get to beta status by the end of March 2009.
